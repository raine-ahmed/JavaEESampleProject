# JavaEESampleProject
A sample code snippet from one of my professional projects. I prepared the spec and design document and then implemented the feature. This snapshot only represents the type of development practices I have been involved in.

1. The "Spec - BDS Secure Workspace Notifications.pdf" file contains the specification of a feature
2. The "Design Doc -BDS Secure Workspace Notifications.pdf" file contains the design document of that feature
3. And finally the "Workspace.java" has some APIs where the feature is implemented. 
 
Please note that this is only a small portion of the whole feature.
