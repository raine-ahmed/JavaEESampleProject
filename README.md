# JavaEESampleProject
A sample project where a feature of a project is implemented. I am sharing only a portion of the feature just to give you an idea about the type of development I am involved in.

1. The "Spec - BDS Secure Workspace Notifications.pdf" file contains the specification of a feature
2. The "Design Doc -BDS Secure Workspace Notifications.pdf" file contains the design document of that feature
3. And finally the "Workspace.java" has some APIs where the feature is implemented. 
 
Please note that this is only a little portion of the whole feature.
